    "reason": "Expert noted unrealistic symmetry in infection curve (descent too fast). Increasing ODE loss weight (1.0→2.0) enforces stricter adherence to SIRD dynamics, which should correct post-peak behavior. Slightly increased initial boundary conditions weight (0.1→0.2) to ensure terminal condition I(t_end)→0 supports realistic descent. No data loss adjustment since fit to observations isn't the issue. Trade-off: stronger physics constraints may reduce flexibility but improves biological plausibility."
