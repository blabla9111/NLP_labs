    "reason": "Expert identified unrealistic symmetry in infection curve (ascent/descent phases). Reduced ODE loss weight (0.5) to allow model flexibility in adjusting descent dynamics beyond strict SIRD constraints. Increased initial boundary conditions weight (0.2) to ensure I(t_end)→0 while maintaining slower descent. Maintained data loss weight to preserve fit to observations. Trade-off: Reduced physics fidelity vs. improved realism in descent phase."
