    "comment": "The symmetry of the infection curve is unrealistic - the descent should be slower than the ascent.",

    "reason": "The comment is specific, identifies a clear issue (curve symmetry), and proposes an objective adjustment (slower descent). It aligns with valid database examples that critique symmetry and propose realistic curve adjustments.",

    "reason": "Expert comment highlights unrealistic symmetry in infection curve descent. Increasing ODE_loss_weight (1.5×) enforces stricter adherence to SIRD dynamics for more gradual descent. Slightly lowering data_loss_weight (75.0) allows model flexibility to adjust curve shape beyond data points. Increasing initial_boundary_conditions_loss_weight (0.2) ensures I(t_end)→0 constraint is satisfied through more biologically plausible decay rates rather than abrupt drops. Trade-off: reduced data fidelity for improved epidemiological realism."
