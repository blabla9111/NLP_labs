    "reason": "Expert comment indicates infection peak is too low (should be 15-20% of population). Increasing peak_height_loss_weight to 0.05 to penalize models that underpredict peak magnitude. Maintaining other weights since ODE constraints and boundary conditions aren't mentioned as problematic. Trade-off: Higher peak penalty may cause overfitting to peak height at the expense of other model aspects, but 0.05 is a conservative starting value."
