The tool is called: check_comment_validity
START similarity_search from DB
The tool is called: get_new_comment_from_expert
Your previous comment can't be used, because The comment lacks specificity, clear purpose, focus, and uses subjective language. It does not describe a concrete observation or problem in the forecast.
. There are some recommendations Provide a specific observation (e.g., 'the peak is offset by 10 days'), state the purpose clearly (e.g., 'to adjust the timing of the peak'), focus on one issue, and use objective language (e.g., 'the model assumes constant transmissibility').. 
Write, please, new one: The symmetry of the infection curve is unrealistic - the descent should be slower than the ascent.

START similarity_search from DB
The tool is called: get_new_comment_from_expert
Your previous comment can't be used, because The comment is unrelated to the epidemiological forecast and does not address any specific issue with the model or data. It fails to meet criteria for concreteness, purpose, focus, and relevance to the forecast.
. There are some recommendations Ensure comments address specific forecast elements (e.g., model assumptions, timing of peaks, policy impacts). Use objective language to describe a single, clear issue with actionable implications for the forecast..
Write, please, new one: The infection peak seems too low compared to the total population. Peak should be around 15-20%.
